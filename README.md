# Invoice Sync Service

A production-ready backend service that keeps invoices, payments, and
general ledger accounts in sync between an internal invoicing system and
QuickBooks Online (QBO) — in both directions.

Internal changes (create, update, void) are pushed to QBO via a durable
job queue. QBO changes made by accountants arrive via webhook and are
pulled into the internal system. Field-level conflict detection handles
the case where both sides change the same invoice concurrently.

Key properties:
- **Durable** — BullMQ with exponential backoff; reconciliation watchdog
  re-queues stuck or failed jobs every 15 minutes
- **Idempotent** — BullMQ jobId deduplication + EventLog unique constraint
  + find-or-link on duplicate QBO create
- **Loop-safe** — pull path writes directly to the DB, never through the
  invoice use-case, preventing infinite push/pull cycles
- **Conflict-aware** — field-level rules auto-resolve most conflicts;
  `dueDate` changes on both sides require human resolution via API

Built with: Node.js 24 · TypeScript · Fastify · PostgreSQL · Prisma ·
BullMQ · Redis

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 LTS
- pnpm
- Docker + Docker Compose
- A QuickBooks Online developer account and sandbox company
  (<https://developer.intuit.com>)
- ngrok or equivalent for local webhook delivery

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in all values. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below.
Generate the encryption key with:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 3. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

### 5. Authenticate with QuickBooks

This is a one-time step that stores encrypted OAuth tokens in the database.
Ensure `QB_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback` is set in `.env`
and that nothing else is running on port 3000 — the auth script starts its
own temporary server to capture the callback.

```bash
pnpm qbo-auth
```

Open the printed URL in a browser and complete the OAuth consent. The
terminal will confirm when tokens are saved and print their expiry times.

### 6. Configure webhook delivery

QBO webhooks require a public URL. For local development use ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

In the QBO developer portal, set the webhook endpoint to:
`https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.dev/webhooks/qbo`

Copy the Verifier Token from the portal into `QB_WEBHOOK_VERIFIER_TOKEN`
in `.env`. Without this, webhook signature verification will reject all
incoming events.

### 7. Start the service

The service runs as two separate processes. Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1 — HTTP server:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Should log: `Server listening at http://0.0.0.0:3000`

**Terminal 2 — Queue worker:**
```bash
pnpm worker
```
Should log: `Workers started`

The worker handles all BullMQ jobs (reconcile push, pull from QBO,
payment sync, polling reconciliation). Without it, invoices will be
created in the DB but never synced to QBO.

### 8. Import QBO mappings

With the service running, pull accounts, items, and customers from your
QBO sandbox:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sync/mappings/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(grep API_KEY .env | cut -d= -f2)"
```

This must be done before pushing any invoices. For initial testing
without per-line item mapping, set these two shortcuts in `.env`
(sandbox only — never use in production):

- `QB_DEFAULT_CUSTOMER_ID` — bypasses CustomerMap lookup; use a QBO
  customer ID (short numeric string like `"28"`) from `GET /sync/mappings`
  → `.customers[0].qboCustomerId`
- `QB_DEFAULT_ITEM_ID` — used when line items have no `internalItemCode`;
  find a valid item ID by checking `GET /sync/mappings` after import and
  copying any `.items[0].qboItemId`

If you get a `502 QBO token refresh failed` error, re-run `pnpm qbo-auth`
to get fresh tokens and retry.

## Running Tests

### Unit tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

Covers: conflict detection engine, field-level rule evaluation, retry
state transitions, AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption, stale event
rejection, partially-paid invoice guard, void/delete handling.
No DB, no QBO API, no Redis — all ports are mocked.

### Integration tests

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

Requires Docker Compose running. Uses a real test database and a mocked
QBO HTTP server (msw). Covers full sync round-trips: create → push →
SyncLink created, duplicate webhook deduplication, conflict detection
and resolution, timeout-after-write recovery, payment sync, partially
paid invoice blocking.

## API Reference

All endpoints except `POST /webhooks/qbo` require:
`Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`

### Health

- `GET /health` — liveness check

### Auth

- `GET /auth/qbo/status` — returns QBO credential validity, expiry,
  and refresh token warning

### Webhooks

- `POST /webhooks/qbo` — QBO change notifications (HMAC verified)

### Sync Status

- `GET /sync/links` — list SyncLink records (`?syncStatus=&limit=`)
- `GET /sync/links/:id` — detail with AuditLog entries

### Conflict Resolution

- `GET /sync/conflicts` — list invoices in CONFLICT status
- `POST /sync/conflicts/:id/resolve` — resolve with
  `{ "strategy": "accept-internal" | "accept-qbo" }`

### Initial Load

- `POST /sync/initial-load/internal-to-qbo` — push all unlinked
  internal invoices to QBO (idempotent)
- `POST /sync/initial-load/qbo-to-internal` — not implemented,
  returns 501 (see DESIGN.md)

### Mappings

- `POST /sync/mappings/import` — import accounts, items, customers
  from QBO
- `GET /sync/mappings` — list current mapping tables

---

## Assumptions

- Both systems expose APIs and emit webhook-like change notifications.
- Webhook payloads are minimal (entity type + id only) — the service
  always refetches the full entity from QBO before processing.
- Events may be duplicated, delayed, or arrive out of order — the
  service handles all three explicitly.
- A single QBO company per deployment (single-tenant).
- Internal invoice deletes are treated as voids in QBO. QBO has no
  un-void API, so restore-from-delete is not supported.
- The internal system sets `DocNumber = internalId` on all outbound
  pushes. This is the key used to find existing QBO invoices on retry
  after a timeout-before-write.
- QBO rate limits apply: sandbox cap is ~150 req/min.
  `QBO_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` defaults to 2/second to stay within that cap.
- `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is managed out of band and never stored in
  the database. Rotation requires manual re-encryption.
- If the service is inactive for more than 100 days, the QBO refresh
  token expires and `pnpm qbo-auth` must be re-run.

## Deploying to Railway

1. Push repo to GitHub
2. Create new Railway project → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Add Postgres plugin → DATABASE_URL set automatically
4. Add Redis plugin → REDIS_URL set automatically
5. Set env vars (QB_CLIENT_ID, QB_CLIENT_SECRET, QB_REALM_ID, QB_WEBHOOK_VERIFIER_TOKEN, QB_REDIRECT_URI, TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY, API_KEY, QB_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox)
6. Set deploy command: `pnpm migrate`
7. Add second Railway service (`worker`) from same repo, override start command to `node dist/worker.js`
8. Run `pnpm qbo-auth` locally pointing QB_REDIRECT_URI at Railway domain to get initial tokens
9. Set QBO webhook endpoint to `https://<web-service>.railway.app/webhooks/qbo`

## Debugging

**Sync failures:** check `GET /sync/links?syncStatus=ERROR` to list failed
records. `GET /sync/links/:id` returns the full AuditLog for that link —
each entry shows the action taken, the result, and the error message if
the job failed.

**Auth errors:** if sync jobs are all failing or QBO API calls are
returning 401, check `GET /auth/qbo/status`. It returns token expiry,
refresh token expiry, and a warning flag if the refresh token is within
14 days of the 100-day cliff.

**CONFLICT records:** `GET /sync/conflicts` lists all invoices blocked
by a conflict. Resolve via `POST /sync/conflicts/:id/resolve` with
`{ "strategy": "accept-internal" | "accept-qbo" }`.
